## What will the application do?
Yet Unnamed Dungeon Crawler is a project aimed at creating a top-down 
sprite and text-based roguelike dungeon crawler similar to Dwarf Fortress and 
Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup. In short, it is a game about fighting enemies and 
exploring dungeons, while trying to stay alive.

## Who will use it?
The game is intended for anyone, from casual players to diehard gamers. 
Of course, this game will not rival AAA titles of today, but it should still give users 
a fun experience to run around and explore.

## Why is this project of interest to you?
Video game development was one of my first forays into programming and software-development. 
One of my first coding projects in 2016 was a top-down terminal-based game named "spikemaze". 
Then, in 2017, one of my first major projects was another open-world 2d Minecraft-inspired 
adventure game. For this CPSC 210 project, I wanted to continue this trend by building another 
2d game as an introduction to Software Construction.
